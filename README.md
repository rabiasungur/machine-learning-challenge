Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. In this repo, you will find two  machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset which includes preprocessing, tuning the model parameters and model performences.

# Context
The Kepler Space Observatory is a NASA-build satellite that was launched in 2009. The telescope is dedicated to searching for exoplanets in star systems besides our own, with the ultimate goal of possibly finding other habitable planets besides our own. The original mission ended in 2013 due to mechanical failures, but the telescope has nevertheless been functional since 2014 on a "K2" extended mission.

Kepler had verified 1284 new exoplanets as of May 2016. As of October 2017 there are over 3000 confirmed exoplanets total (using all detection methods, including ground-based ones). The telescope is still active and continues to collect new data on its extended mission.

# Content

This dataset is a cumulative record of all observed Kepler "objects of interest" â€” basically, 
all of the approximately 10,000 exoplanet candidates Kepler has taken observations on.

This dataset has an extensive data dictionary, which can be accessed here: https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_kepcandidate_columns.html
